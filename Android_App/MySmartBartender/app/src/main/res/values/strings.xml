    <string name="description"> This application was created to go along with the Bartender project.
        It was created by me aka Sagar Patel. The app connects to a Bartender machine and can control the bartender.
        I built the software and hardware pretty much from scratch. If you want you can look at the code through my github
        and check out my other projects as well. You can find link to my github on my website www.sagarpatel.dev If you
        have any questions or suggestions you can send them to through my contact email 10sagarpatel@gmail.com
        I got the inspiration of the project from Hackster.io . I found many Bartender projects on there, and based mines
        of them with a more additions as well.
